    <h3 style="color: #0066CC;">Doc-Centric Sales: South Region</h3>
    <p>
        The South was a pleasant surprise for Doc-Centric in the last year. Copier sales in this region have been historically slow, but last year saw a general 25% increase in all sales. The M100-1S model sold particularly well. We hope this trend will continue.
